        <h2>Emily Dickenson Analysis</h2>
          <h4>Excerpt from my paper 'Death's Two Faces.'</h4>
            <p>In Poem 591, death has a new face. Dickinson presents death as a fly. Small, swift, and delicate, flies are the least bit suspicious. She is able to paint death in a different way compared to Poem 479. Death, in that poem, had the ability to drive carriages and lead her into the next life; he was strong and silent. The fly can be just the opposite. With its ominous buzzing and capacity for looming, the fly sets a grim scene.</p>

        <h2>Phillis Wheatley Analysis</h2>
          <h4>Excerpt from my paper 'Praised and Preached,' specifically the thesis.</h4>
            <p>Phillis Wheatley's 'To S.M., A young African Painter, on Seeing His Works' and 'To the University of Cambridge, in New England,' are epistolary poems written in the year 1773. What defines these two works from one another is their tone. Wheatley is able to manipulate her tone, given different audiences, in order to emphasize the importance of Christian faith and what it means to her as an African American woman. What is special about the distinction between both of these works is how she addresses a fellow African American artist and how she approaches reaching a young educated white audience; one is praised while the other is preached.</p>

        <h2>Margaret Cavendish Analysis</h2>
          <h4>Excerpt from my paper 'The Power of Praise.'</h4>
            <p>The pivotal moment within this poem is when Cavendish says, 'Then all in haste I to the press it sent, Fearing persuasion might my book prevent….' Cavendish decides to publish despite the risks. Although filled with doubt, she chooses to follow her gut. Although faced with adversity, she sees beyond it. The last two stanzas, 'Take pity, and my drooping spirits raise, Wife off my tears with handkerchiefs of praise,' express the longing for recognition by Cavendish. She is addressing the public herself here to exile her fear, doubt, and anxiety by justifying the credibility of her work through praise. Positive public recognition will not only relieve her of her doubts but also allow her to acquire something rare to women of this time; power.</p>

        <h2>Shakespeare Analysis (Romeo and Juliet)</h2>
          <h4>Excerpt from my paper 'Manhood,' specifically the thesis.</h4>
            <p>What is means to be a man is one of man’s strongest drivers. However important it may be, how to achieve manhood can be difficult because many men have different definitions of what a man should be. The stereotypical definition of what it means to be a man has always cursed men. They are expected to be strong, unemotional, loyal, courageous, and sometimes brutal in any type of situation. Men are key to violence, untouched by weakness, and sworn to a cause, or, at least, they are 'supposed' to be. This ideology about men is seen throughout the following Shakespearian literature: Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.</p>
